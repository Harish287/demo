                Unikaa's was conceived with the idea of the modern Indian.
                Founded by K. Veena, whose knowledge of the international beauty
                industry pioneered a new era in the hair and beauty care
                industry in India, Unikaa's has made a path-breaking change in
                the way the beauty industry has been perceived.
                <p></p>
                So in the early 2000s, she made that dream a reality by setting
                up her first salon in Chennai. It took her only a while to
                understand the market potential and the ever-increasing demand
                for professional grooming. In 2004 her husband co-founder & CEO,
                CK Kumaravel joined and ever since then, the Unikaa's team has
                been able to meet every challenge in this competitive industry.
